This project recreates the classic arcade-style game Flappy Bird using Python and the Pygame game development library.<br>
It captures the original game’s simple yet addictive mechanics, allowing players to control a bird and guide it through a series of obstacles, aiming to survive as long as possible.

## Gameplay Preview

Below is a short preview of the gameplay, showcasing the bird navigating through narrow gaps between pipes. Players must carefully time each flap using the spacebar to stay airborne, as even a single collision with the obstacles or ground results in game over.
